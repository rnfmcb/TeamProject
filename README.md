# Team Extra 
Team Project for Software Professions Spring Semmester of 2019 at UMSL University 

Team members: Rachel Festervand, Mitch Lindsey, Tim Schisler, Tyler Sullivan 

The purpose of our project was to use agile methods to design an extracurricular or experience transcript, based on high impact education practices, that can be given to future employers and used for research for UMSL University.  

We provided user stories for multiple iterations of the project, designed a "Proof of Concept" website and a database.
